# Testing Instructions

1. Install and activate older versions of some simple and complex plugins such as akismet jetpack mailpoet woocommerce wordpress-seo wpforms-lite. You can download older versions from the plugins repository by navigating to  Development > Advanced, then scroll to the bottom and download an older version. WP-CLI users can pass a --version parameter with the version number to install and activate. You may also simply decrease the version number in the main plugin file locally.
